# C - Functions, nested loops

## Description
This project focuses on the use of functions and nested loops in C. It introduces the use of header files and the practice of writing code without the standard library.

## Learning Objectives
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* The difference between function declaration and definition
* What is a prototype and why it is used
* How to use header files with `#include`
